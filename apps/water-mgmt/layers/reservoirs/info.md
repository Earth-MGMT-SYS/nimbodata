# Reservoir Levels

This layer brings data from the 
[California Data Exchange Center](http://cdec.water.ca.gov), 
[Bureau of Reclamation](http://www.usbr.gov/lc/riverops.html) and 
[Salt River Project](https://www.srpwater.com/dwr/) together.

The layer is symbolized based on the maximum WY2014 water level compared with
the reservoir capacity.

The period of record is limited for this dataset, and comparisons are made 
to the reservoir capacity as opposed to the maximum historical value.  The data
has not yet been processed to remove outliers, so there may be extremely high
false values that will throw off charts and the like.
