# Snow Pack

This layer consists primarily of [NRCS Snotel](http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/snow/) 
data.  The layer has the full POR for each station.  The POR are typically 
around 20-30 years, but the network has continually expanded so there are 
plenty of younger stations.

The layer is symbolized on the WY2014 average snow-water eqiavlent inches vs
the period of record WY-average value.

There is also [BCRFC](http://bcrfc.env.gov.bc.ca/) data floating around in 
there as well, but I do not have the current-year functionality and their 
archive didn't include 2012-2014...
