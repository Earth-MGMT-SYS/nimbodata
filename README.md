Python/Javascript Data Platform.

With the powers of PostgreSQL, Python and Javascript combined, we are captain data platform!

## Installation ##

To begin, you need a few things pip can't provide.  Arch or Ubuntu 14.04 is recommended, and since it still requires beta-software, it is not for the faint of heart.

*   PostgreSQL 9.4 (beta), you will also need plpython2u
*   gdal-bin, gdal-dev
*   Python 2.7 and python-dev
*   nodejs (also npm)

For node and the remaining Python requirements, pip install and npm install should handle it.

## More Info ##

The software is still beta, the packaging is not quite there yet.  This is mostly for perusal and those willing to perhaps brave a round or two of missing modules.
