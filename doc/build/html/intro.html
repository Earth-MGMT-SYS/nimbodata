<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Nimbodata aims to enable distributed management systems.  The core capabilities
of any management system include the collection, validation, management,
analysis, communication of structured information in the furtherance of an
objective.  Nimbodata expands upon the now age-old concepts of a relational
database and GIS, but makes them Python, REST and Javascript native, with
a sprinking of modern goodness like an object store thrown in.</p>
<p>Nimbodata is a platform inspired by Python, Zope, ArcGIS and infuriated
by SharePoint; aimed at producing a cross-platform, standards-based approach
to developing and deploying applications that exist beyond a particular device
or machine.</p>
<p>We will:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Enable truly distributed, data-driven applications with an approach influenced
by github.  By encapsulating the data and code into a single, self-hosting
data platform that provides revision control and cloning capabilities.</li>
<li>Provide quick and easy access to the world&#8217;s free data, enabling users to
develop and share applications to evaluate and act upon the mountains of data
that are available.</li>
<li>Enable people ranging from analysts to developers to create domain-specific
and cross-domain management systems that are easy to deploy, maintain and
customize.</li>
<li>Provide a cloud platform to store and share data and applications, which
is masterless and decentralized.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="functional-description">
<h2>Functional Description<a class="headerlink" href="#functional-description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Nimbodata is a platform for the full life cycle of collection, management
and analysis of structured data.  Nimbodata makes a relational data store
available via a REST interface, which enables a rich, Pythonic client as
well as a Python/JavaScript MVC framework for developing data-driven
applications.</p>
<p>Currently implemented in Nimbodata:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Relational datastore powered by PostgreSQL 9.4 offering jsonb, PostGIS and
range queries (and Python types to support them).</li>
<li>Metadata manager which provides UUID-style naming for entities, which
enables both distributed operation as well as renaming without side-
effects.</li>
<li>REST interface which provides 100% access to the capabilities of the
datastore.</li>
<li>Python client which includes queries driven by JSON or pythonic overloaded
operators a-la SQLAlchemy but without chaining.</li>
<li>Javascript MVC client including 10+ widgets, a layout manager and data
model for navigating and viewing data. Apps are composed primarily of a css
file and a JSON structure, however, the architecture allows for simple
extensibility in Javascript.</li>
<li>Update tool which can ingest web services, csv, geodatabases and shapefiles.</li>
<li>Owner-based permissions model.</li>
<li>Data input forms automatically generated from a database table, leveraging
database constraints and a JSON schema for validation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rudiments in place, More Dev Planned:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Temporal database capability.  All non-schema changes are currently captured
as append-only and presented via a current-view.  Query engine support for
querying the state as of a particular date needs integration.  Waiting on
integration with ZFS for cloning and schema-change checkpointing.</li>
<li>Nimbodata analysis engine.  A set of tools and datatypes which enable the
same capabilities across the datastore and analysis layer.  Mostly in place,
just needs to be exposed properly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Longer term goals:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Workflows and global event manager.</li>
<li>Conflict manager for managing merges in structural context.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="vision">
<h2>Vision<a class="headerlink" href="#vision" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We reject the notion of domain-specific platforms, the challenges of the 21st
century are not specific to any given specialty or domain, instead, they
require cooperation amongst a variety of fields to acheive successful outcomes.</p>
<p>The Python ecosystem provides the ability to effectively interact with nearly
any form of digital information with an idiom that encourages easy-to-read
code.  Platforms such as a GIS or CMS provide domain-specific implementations
on top of basically the same core functionality - a relational data store.</p>
<p>While there have been many platforms with similar core concepts since the days
of the earliest mainframes, technology has developed to enable a few key
features previously infeasible:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Provide reasonable performance and a high-level interface.</li>
<li>Take advantage of the maturation of web standards to the point where client
platform independence is feasible using simple techniques.</li>
<li>A distributed cloud architecture will allow users to take advantage of
public data sources as well as private-cloud and private-local data in
a seamless manner.</li>
<li>Encapsulate the application logic, design, structure, documentation and
data into a single distributed, revision-managed platform built on simple
rudiments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other aspects of the vision which aren&#8217;t really enabled by technology, but
don&#8217;t seem to have been picked up by others:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Enable cooperation amongst groups with different interests and policies for
sharing data while providing a decentralized platform to manage the flow of
data.</li>
<li>Provide a rich data library which allows users full query access to as much
data as possible in a consistent format (i.e. follow naming standards
and establish extensive foreign key relationships).</li>
<li>Python is great for programmers, but the spirit is wholly applicable to
data analysis tools.  By providing a powerful platform for users to levarage
Python, we hope to expand the power and reach of the Python ecosystem.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="what-s-unique">
<h2>What&#8217;s Unique<a class="headerlink" href="#what-s-unique" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While superficially similar concepts exist (such as SQLAlchemy and
Flask-Restless), Nimbodata strives to develop a full-stack platform inspired by
Zope and infuriated by SharePoint and ArcGIS.</p>
<p>Currently the key unique concepts fully implemented in Nimbodata are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Append-only modification mode for data and metadata (not including
structure currently)</li>
<li>Metadata-mediated queries which reduce the risk of allowing ad hoc
queries to untrusted users (all database input is either parameterized,
or for identifiers, fulfilled via catalog not user input).</li>
<li>Full functionality via REST/JSON</li>
<li>Tiling, simplifying GeoJSON query functionality integrated with
view-of-view and full relational query capabilities.</li>
<li>All relationships are by ID not name, allowing side-effect-free renames</li>
<li>Python (geo)data analysis engine with Catalog and Atlas GUI which is
completely FOSS.</li>
<li>Automatically ingest Shapefiles from URL of a zip archive.</li>
<li>Widget-based Javascript MVC which directly fits the core data model
with over 10 widgets including forms automatically generated from
table schema, a slippy map, and more (more added regularly).</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Ongoing development is aimed at the following unique capabilities:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Micro-versioning (temporal database) for all non-structural changes
(inserts/updates/deletes/renames/create_*)</li>
<li>Macro-versioning to reproduce state for each database structurural
change not encapsulated by microversioning</li>
<li>Push/Pull ala git</li>
<li>Ability to control versioning behavior on a default and per-table basis</li>
<li>Platform applications self-hosted from database - versioning covers apps</li>
<li>Inherent streaming replication to support read-isolation for queries</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-the-same">
<h2>What&#8217;s The Same<a class="headerlink" href="#what-s-the-same" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Nimbodata is inspired by the power of the relational database.  While Nimbodata
is currently implemented on a SQL database and is closely based on the
functionality of PostgreSQL, we do not strive to be SQL-compliant or to limit
Nimbodata to the implementation decisions of SQL.  Most PostgreSQL types are
reused with the same names.  Most PostGIS types have been simplified and
condensed (i.e. LineString and MultiLineString are now just Line).</p>
